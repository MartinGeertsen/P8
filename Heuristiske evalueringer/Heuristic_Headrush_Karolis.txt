Heuristic evaluation - Headrush


The options on the right, can ONLY be controlled with the buttons and no touch possbilities is aviable. 
When trying to see what's more in the options menu(the same as above), it won't work. It only works with clicks. These clicks makes an instant effect of a scrolling to the other buttons that are not seen in the main screen. (Give pictures)
You can easily be confusied if you are going to see more options or if your just browsing through the same options..
It is easy to see when you are at the button, when there is only one more option left(because then there'll be a big space with notthing, to indicate, that you have reached the end of the options.



The mapping from the board and the touch screen is not the same.


Maximum of 8 Different presets or effect at one time.
The are maching the numbers of pushbuttons on the board from the screen.
Other layouts gives more options, but it is confusing.

It is possible to move the effect to another place on the screen, but it doesn't effect the position on the buttons.

No indiaction of where i am (ON THE RIG, Bank).. 


Limited areas to click on. But i cannot get to the part of where i shut down the tempo and change the location of what i see on the screen and what is on the buttons.


When searching at the effects, it got the same colors on every option. But when choosing a certain option, the certain option have the same colors in the same category, e.g. Distortion have the color of Yellow, of and of its sub effects, but it's only shown when have choosen the effect, not before.

When using the buttons i takes ages to turn it (THe big PISH TO ENTER)
The others are way faster (To the right).

Need more microcopying in the settings. Some of them doesn't make sens of what they do. E.g: Assignments (AUTO ASSIGN) ON/OFF.. But what does it auto assign for?

Way faster to get into.
But the above approvements have to be done, before it it useable.
