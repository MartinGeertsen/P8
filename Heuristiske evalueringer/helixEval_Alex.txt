Heuristic evaluation Helix

	All editing buttons are turn and press buttons, except the joystick but this is clearly marked
	turning the joystick button just cycles trough all of the effects no matter where you are in the editing
	turning the buttons under the screen really fast makes the editing number jump
	when saving presets, feels wierd that you dont select the letters you want to use
